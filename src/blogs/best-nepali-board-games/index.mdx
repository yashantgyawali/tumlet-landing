## 1. Bluff Momo

_A lying game that gets better the more you lie._

![Bluff Momo](/blogs/best-nepali-board-games/bluff-momo.png)

Set in the chaos of Kathmandu's streets, Bluff Momo is all about deception. You can pretend to be any character to use their power â€” like claiming to be the Chor to steal someone's momo. But if someone calls your bluff and you were lying, you lose cards. If you were telling the truth, they lose cards instead.

It's funny, unpredictable, and full of "I knew it!" moments.

#### Why I love it:

- The artwork and characters feel very Nepali
- It's not luck-based. 
- Every game plays out differently â€” high replayability
- Once you learn it, it's all about reading people, not rules

#### What it's not great for:

- Parties â€” strategy and lying don't mix well with drinks
- Kids â€” too much to track
- First-time players â€” steep learning curve in the beginning

#### My experience:

Parents often hesitate to learn this one. But once they get it, they're hooked â€” they'll keep asking to play "just one more round."

(For the record, my dad loses every time. He's just too honest to survive in this game.)

## 2. Samrajya

_Simple dice game based on Nepal's unification history._

![Samrajya Board](/blogs/best-nepali-board-games/samrajya.png)

You roll the dice, move your token, and follow what the board says. Cards throw in a bit of randomness. The goal is to conquer the valley, just like Prithvi Narayan Shah did.

#### Why I love it:
- The artwork and characters feel very Nepali
- Teaches you a bit of history
- Easy for kids and grandparents to learm

#### What it's not great for:

- Strategy-heavy players
- People who hate losing to luck
- Less replaybility for adults

#### My experience:

I've played this with 7-year-olds and grandparents, and it was really easy to introduce this to them. Nice to have if you want to bring something historical to the table. But not something I'd play every weekend.

## 3. Baag Chal

_A timeless Nepali strategy gameâ€”no luck, all brainpower._

![baag chal](/blogs/best-nepali-board-games/baag-chal.png)

One player controls 4 tigers, the other 20 goats, on a 5 Ã—5 board. Tigers jump goats to capture them; goats try to trap the tigers.

#### Why I love it:
- Pure strategy â€” no luck involved
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- Travel-friendly â€” draw it in chalk and use pebbles if you need to

Baag Chal is fading from everyday play, but apps, tournaments, and beautiful wooden boards are helping keep it alive.

## 4. Marriage card game
_A fast-paced rummy-style game with deep roots in Nepali culture._

![Marriage card game](/blogs/best-nepali-board-games/marriage.png)

Marriage (aka Nepali Taas) uses three decks, and each player gets 21 cards. The goal: build valid sets â€” like pure sequences, dublee (pairs), and special combos like Marriage (Tiplu, Jhiplu, Poplu). There's a joker for every round, but you only find out what it is after meeting a few conditions.

It's part strategy, part memory, and part luck â€” with moments of pure chaos when someone finishes out of nowhere.

#### Why I like it:
- Fast-paced but still strategic
- Easy to jump into once you've seen it played once
- Really fun with experienced players

#### What I dislike:
- The rules & the scoring system aren't beginner-friendly
- You need 3 decks of card to play
- The game are usually long 

#### Where to play:

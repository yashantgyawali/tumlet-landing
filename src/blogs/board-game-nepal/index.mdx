Board games in Nepal, especially in Kathmandu, are no longer just for kids. 

These days, you can spot people playing all kinds of games in different corners of the city. Walk into a local chiya pasal and you might see at least one group deep into an online game of Ludo.

In the past few years, game nights have popped up in caf√©s, bars, and even offices. People now meet not just to eat, but to sit around a table, laugh, and PLAY.

If you've been searching for board games in Nepal or wondering where to play, this guide is for you. Here's a tour of game nights, caf√©s with games, and local Nepali board games you can buy.

## 1. Board Game Nights in Nepal

### Tumlet Game Nights

Tumlet is a Nepali board game brand that makes games for young adults with high replay value. We want to grow the board game culture in Nepal, so we host free game nights every month.

We bring a mix of games (Nepali and bestsellers) for different tastes and love teaching them to new players. You can meet people, try games you've never seen before, and spark new connections. 

Or just play for the fun of it.

üì© **Note:** We usually host games nights 1st friday of each month. [DM us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tumlet.boardgames/) to know when our next game night is.

### Nextdoor ‚Äì Free Game Night Every Thursday

Nextdoor, in Sanepa, runs a free board game night every Thursday from 6 PM. You can just walk in, pick a game, and join a table. If you're new, they'll happily teach you how to play.

It's a friendly, inclusive space where anyone can join ‚Äî no matter how much experience you have. It's the perfect place to wind down, connect with new people, and learn some of the most popular games.

üì± [Follow them on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stay.nextdoor/?hl=en) for updates.

## 2. Caf√©s and Restaurants with Board Games

Several caf√©s in Kathmandu keep board games ready for customers. You only pay for your food or drinks, and the games are free to play.

### The Chiya Spot

With several branches around the city, Chiyaspot is a hangout spot for tea lovers. You'll often see a group balancing a Jenga tower while sipping tea. I love their seating options. You can even sit on the floor, which is perfect for board games.

### Mellow Bakeshop

This is your stop if you want the best cheesecake in town while playing a round of a Nepali board game. Their game collection is small, but if you have a sweet tooth and a soft spot for games, Mellow is worth the trip.

### Khushi Coffee House

Khusi Caf√© might just have the biggest board game collection in the city. From Ticket to Ride to Catan, they've got it all. The owner is passionate about games and has created a cozy space where you can play for hours without any extra charge.

### ‚òïÔ∏è Daily Drip

A fun little caf√© run by friendly owners who are always happy to join you for a game. They've got a good collection, and the coffee is excellent. If you go, try a few rounds of Guess Who with friends. Btw I've never lost a single round.

These spots are perfect for long, lazy game days when you don't want to host at home.

## 3. Nepali Board Games You Can Try and Buy

Board game Nepal is not just about imported games ‚Äî local creators are making amazing ones too.

### Bluff Momo ‚Äì By Tumlet

Our first game, Bluff Momo, is all about deception and Nepali humor. You'll meet characters like Hante, Aama, and Bhatti ko Dai. Bluff momo has a bit of a learning curve to it. You need to memorize different powers. But once you do that, you can end of playing for hours.

üí∞ **Price:** Rs. 1490

### Samrajya ‚Äì By Alchi

Alchi is another Nepali brand making games with cultural and educational twists for Nepali Kids. Samrajya was their first game and is filled with Nepali touches. It's simple enough for kids, but still fun for adults.

They have plenty more games worth checking out. See the full collection here: [alchi.co](https://alchi.co)

        <h1 class="header"> How to play bluff momo?</h1>
        <div class="hero-text body-text">The objective of Bluff Momo game is to collect as many momo as you can and food-poison other players to be the last one standing with at least 1 character card and claim the title of ‘Bluff Momo Master.’ </div>
     
        <h2 class="header2">The setup:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="font-inter">Each player starts with 2 momo.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">Shuffle the 15 cards (5 characters, 3 of each) and deal 2 cards to each player. Players can look at their cards but keep them face-down in front of them.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">Place the remaining cards face-down in the middle.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="header2">Gameplay:</h2>
        <span>Starting with a player to the right of the dealer, players take turns performing one of the following actions:</span>
        <ol>
            <li class="font-inter">Claim to be one of the 5 characters and use its power (<a href="#rules-table"> refer to the table</a>). You can bluff, but be careful—anyone can challenge you.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">Take 1 momo without claiming any character. Cannot be blocked or challenged.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">Collect as many momo as you can, and when you have 7, you can food-poison any player. The poisoned player loses 1 card of their choice. Cannot be blocked or challenged.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">If you run out of both your cards, you're eliminated from the game.</li>
        </ol>
        <span>Note: If you have 10+ momo, you must use 7 momo to food-poison another player in your next turn. </span>
    
        <h2 class="header2"> Bluffing and challenges:</h2>
        Challenge rule: When you claim to have a character card, any player can challenge you to reveal the card and prove it:
        <ol>
            <li class="font-inter">If you’re truthful: The challenger loses 1 card of their choice (return it to the deck), and you exchange the revealed card for a random card from the deck.</li>
            <li class="font-inter">If you’re bluffing: You lose 1 card of your choice (return it to the deck), and the challenger wins 1 momo.</li>
        </ol>   
        Blocking rule: The powers of चोर, मन्त्री, and भट्टीको दाई used against you can be blocked by claiming to have certain characters (<a href="#rules-table">>refer to the table</a>). However, this claim can also be challenged by any player, and the same challenge rule applies.<br>
        Double trouble rule: If you're poisoned by a player with भट्टीको दाई and you either: 1) challenge their claim and lose, or 2) bluff by claiming to have आमा to block the poison, but get challenged and lose, you lose both cards—one for the poison and one for the failed challenge.
